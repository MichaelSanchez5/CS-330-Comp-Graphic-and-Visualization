Portfolio Reflection:
How I Approach Designing Software?:
Through my work on the 3D scene project, I've developed several valuable design skills that have transformed my approach to software development. I've learned to create detailed wireframes and mockups before implementation, which helped me visualize the final scene and identify potential challenges early. Working with 3D objects taught me to think spatially and consider how different components interact in a three-dimensional space, a skill I hadn't fully developed before.

My design process began with requirements gathering, where I identified the key elements needed for my scene. I then created sketches and diagrams to plan the layout and relationships between objects. Before coding, I researched appropriate textures, lighting techniques, and object models that would bring my vision to life. This structured approach helped me avoid major redesigns later in the process.
These design tactics will be invaluable in future work. The practice of thorough planning before implementation can be applied to any software project, reducing rework and improving efficiency. Breaking complex visual problems into manageable components is another transferable skill that will help me tackle large-scale projects across different domains.

How I Approach Developing Programs?:
While working on my 3D scene, I adopted several new development strategies. I implemented modular programming by creating separate functions for different scene elements, which made the code more maintainable and easier to debug. I also learned to use version control more effectively, creating branches for experimental features without risking the stability of my main project.
Iteration was central to my development process. I began with basic shapes and progressively refined them, adding textures, lighting, and interactive elements with each iteration. This approach allowed me to have a working scene at all times while continuously improving its quality and complexity. I found that regular testing after small changes helped identify issues early when they were easier to fix.

My approach to coding evolved significantly throughout the project milestones. Initially, I focused on getting basic functionality working, often writing code that accomplished the task but wasn't necessarily elegant or efficient. As I progressed, I became more conscious of performance considerations, especially important in graphics programming where frame rates matter. By the final milestone, I was refactoring code for clarity and optimization before adding new features, showing a maturation in my development process.

How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals?:
Computational graphics and visualizations have expanded my educational pathway by bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications. Understanding how mathematical principles translate into visual representations has deepened my comprehension of linear algebra, geometry, and physics. These connections make abstract concepts more tangible and have sparked my interest in exploring advanced topics like computational geometry and computer vision in future coursework.

Professionally, these skills open doors to diverse career opportunities. The technical knowledge I've gained in shader programming, texture mapping, and 3D modeling is directly applicable to industries like game development, simulation, virtual reality, and architectural visualization. Additionally, the problem-solving approaches used in graphics programming—breaking complex visual challenges into manageable components—transfer well to other domains of software development. The ability to create visual representations of data will be valuable in fields ranging from scientific research to business analytics, where communicating complex information effectively is essential. Conclusion:-
For this assignment, creating this 3D scene project was indeed beneficial since it gave the practical application of the theoretical understanding of computational graphics and visualization. During the design and development process of iterative design and development, I acquired more insights about 3D modeling, rendering, and scene compositions. I have also acquired essential personal attributes compounded with precise problem-solving skills, critical thinking capacities and efficient organizational capabilities for a project.
Some of the difficulties worked for – optimization of the rendering, for example, or fixing monstrous bugs, teach patience and perseverance.
